'Effective Feb. 11, FAU Boulevard will be closed at Spanish River \r\nBoulevard for three to four weeks as the FAU Research Park widens the \r\nentrance and FAU Boulevard to four lanes. A security officer will be \r\nstationed at the park\'s parking lot entrance on Spanish River Blvd. and \r\nwill allow access only to research park tenants.\r\n\r\nStudents, faculty and staff will need to use other campus entrances and \r\nexits during this time. The best alternatives will be the two Glades \r\nRoad entrances. The 20th Street entrance is heavily impacted each \r\nweekday morning and afternoon by the A.D. Henderson school traffic \r\n(peak times are from 7:30 to 8:15 a.m. and from 2:30 to 3:15 p.m.)  \r\nPlease plan accordingly and allow extra travel time to arrive safely.\r\n\r\nThis much needed improvement will allow for easier access to the Boca \r\nRaton campus.

'Dr. Zhu,\r\n\r\nYou asked if the information gain due to an attribute could be negative.  I \r\nlooked at entropy which is between 0 1and 1.

If you take the extreme case of no \r\nrandomness where their is no randomness then the system entropy is 1.

'January 30, 2007\r\n\r\nDear Florida Resident,\r\n\r\nBiscayne Bay and its associated coastal ecosystems are some of Florida’s most valuable natural resources.  The bay provides habitat for a productive and diverse community of tropical marine plants and animals.  It offers a variety of commercial and recreational opportunities to visitors and the residents of Metropolitan Miami-Dade County. But throughout the last century, rapid population growth, urbanization, and development of the Miami-Dade County area have significantly altered Biscayne Bay.\r\n\r\nEfforts are underway to preserve, protect, and restore Biscayne Bay and the surrounding coastal habitats.  Since 1987, Miami-Dade Department of Environmental Resources Management (DERM) has completed 40 habitat restoration projects (22 coastal sites and on 18 island sites) along and in Biscayne Bay. DERM has restored and enhanced the following south Florida ecosystem components: 70-acres of tropical hardwood hammock, 30-acres of dune/coastal strand, 400 acres of coastal wetlands (mangrove forest, salt marsh, fresh/ brackish water wetlands), and 3-acres of seagrass. Approximately 100 native species are presently being used to restore dune, coastal strand, tropical hardwood hammock, isolated freshwater wetlands, marine wetlands, and submerged aquatic vegetation communities throughout the coastal areas of southeast Florida.  The projects primarily consist of removing exotic vegetation and planting native vegetation at most sites to recreate pref! erred types of coastal communities. Additional activities include providing recreational amenities (boat docking facilities and picnic areas on public lands).\r\n\r\nThis survey which is funded by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and administered through the University of Florida seeks your opinion about Biscayne Bay restoration programs. \r\n\r\nYou have been chosen as part of a small sample of Miami Dade residents asked to complete an online survey. Your participation is completely voluntary. Completion of the survey should take no longer than 10 minutes. You must be 18 years or older to complete the survey. You are assured of complete confidentiality. Participation is totally anonymous. Results will only be reported as summarized data.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for helping us with this study, your responses to these questions are vital to this work.

'Dear IPUMS User,\r\n\r\nOnce again it\'s grant writing time, and once again IPUMS urgently needs \r\nyour help!  Later this month we will apply to the National Institutes of \r\nHealth for the renewal of the main grant funding the IPUMS-USA database. \r\n  Continued funding for the IPUMS data series is contingent on its \r\ncontinued use by the academic and professional research community.\r\n\r\nIt is crucial, therefore, to have a complete list of both published and \r\nforthcoming books, articles, dissertations (completed and in progress), \r\nconference papers, working papers, research reports, fact sheets, and \r\nnewspaper stories that have used IPUMS data. We are also interested in \r\nnews of any classroom or other pedagogical use of the IPUMS, so if you \r\nhave used the data in a course please let us know.\r\n\r\nIf you have done any research using the IPUMS, please visit our \r\nbibliography at http://bibliography.ipums.org to see if we have it.  If \r\nsomething is missing or if you find errors, you can enter the citation \r\nonline or just email the information to ipums@pop.umn.edu.  We suspect \r\nthat a substantial quantity of research published in books and \r\ncollections of essays is missing from our bibliography, since there are \r\nno citation indexes available for those sources.  We would appreciate if \r\nyou can make any additions or corrections to our bibliography as soon as \r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWe would also appreciate it if you would forward this message to any \r\nIPUMS users who may not be registered for our data extraction system; \r\nthis is especially important for people at research centers who may \r\nobtain the data indirectly.\r\n\r\nIf you received this message in error, please accept my apology; it is \r\nsent to everyone who has registered to use the IPUMS unless they have \r\nremoved themselves from our user list.

'How to modify generic Naïve Bayes Classifier to accommodate weighted instances? \r\n \r\nOne way to incorporate the integral weights in Naive Bayes is to \r\ntransform the training dataset on the fly:\r\n \r\n1) Assume weights are              \r\n  x1a  x1b     y1        w1=2\r\n  x2a  x2b     y2        w2=3\r\n \r\nThe modified dataset will look like \r\n  x1a  x1b     y1        w1=2\r\n  x1a  x1b     y1        w1=2\r\n  x2a  x2b     y2        w2=3\r\n  x2a  x2b     y2        w2=3\r\n  x2a  x2b     y2        w2=3\r\n \r\nnow use the out of box Naive Bayes algorithm and it will implicitly use the weights. \r\nOnly an integral weight example is shown but to accomodate weight say 1.1, input dataset can be \r\nreplicated 10 times to achive integral rows of relicated instances for each weight.\r\n \r\nThis is not a very efficient means but the merit lies in using out of the box Naive Bayes algorithm,\r\nwith the modified dataset, to accomodate weighting. Most often we cannot change commercial tools \r\nfor their algorithm.\r\n \r\nThe algorithm can also be modified to do this on the fly as pre-processing of the data.\r\nSuch approach will work for clustering also where if attributes are weighted, the columns can be replicated by integral weights\r\nto avoid true normalization.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n2) The second approach will be like the one suggested for decision tree, where the weights can be used when calculating the probability\r\nfor each class. Example in the sales v/s programming we had 2 cases each and prior probabilities were 0.5 for each kind of posting.\r\nIf we want to weight instances, say programming over sales we could use the weights of each training instance to come up with weighted \r\nprior probabilities.\r\n',Normal

No longer! Medical technology has advanced so far as to allow users to take a simple pill each day and attain the same effects that once required very large amounts of money, time, and patience (not to mention pain tolerance!).\r\n\r\nShed pounds, increase lean muscle mass, reduce wrinkles and all signs of aging, improve your mood and reduce or eliminate signs or symptoms of depression, dramatically boost your energy levels and physical stamina, boost your memory and brain function, help eliminiate stress, fatigue and depression, and so much more. How can one product do all of this? It\\\'s simple, actually.. our produces produce Human Growth Hormone naturally, all throughout our lives.

'It\'s a bit confusing what you wrote. As for a density function, if you put X to be a two dimensional random variable, say it has x1 and x2 indepedent. The joint density is still f(x1, x2)=f(x1)f(x2), you can\'t have something in the exponent with a 2-dimensional random variable but the covariance is one dimensional, meaning only with \\sigma^2.

'Hi Hill and xindong,\r\n\r\nThe presentation at IJCAI went very well.  After my presentation, many\r\npeople tried to ask questions, which shows the real interest in this topic\r\n(as opposed to other presentations, where there are no questions).  After\r\nthe session people come to me and say nice things about the paper.\r\n\r\nI summarize three main questions:\r\n\r\n1. What is the relationship between sequential noise patterns in this\r\npaper and that learned by a hierarchical hidden markov model?\r\n\r\n(my answer: need a deeper understanding of relation between sequential\r\nfrequent patterns which is model-less, and a hidden markov model is\r\nmodel-based)\r\n\r\n2. What if you grow patterns in the opposite way, by incrementally\r\ndeleting letters from a long pattern?  Can you now use a variation of\r\napriori again?\r\n\r\n(my answer: while this is possible, it might be hard for caching (map) to\r\nwork due to the nature of dynamic programming algo).\r\n\r\n3. why not apply data cleaning first to remove all gaps, then insert them\r\nlater to ease the mining?\r\n\r\n(my answer: gaps also convey information so a window size is determined\r\nbased on prior knowledge).\r\n\r\nbest!\r\n\r\n- Qiang\r\n',Normal

It is concerned with patients\' medical records and clinical data. Moreoever, one of the key directions of medical research for the next decade is personalized medicine. This is partly made feasible by recent advances of high throughput biotechnologies, such as comparative genome hybridization arrays, microarrays and mass spectrometry for proteomics and metabolomics.\r\n\r\nIn this special issue of SIGKDD Explorations, we solicit papers on health informatics research which requires mining of large amounts of data - clinical, DNA copy number, gene expression, protein expression and/or metabolonomics data. The following is a non-exhaustive list of possible topics:\r\n\r\n- feature selection for biomarker identification\r\n- cross-platform combinatorial mining of genomics features\r\n- mining transcription factor binding sites\r\n- prediction models of tumor/disease development\r\n- correlation mining of clinic data and genomic data\r\n- mining proteomics and/or metabolomics data\r\n- data mining for personalized medicine\r\n- modeling signalling networks\r\n- temporal and spatial mining of clinic data including medical images\r\n\r\nEach paper must dedicate a significant portion of the paper (e.g., no less than 25\%) describing the health problem being studied. And in light of the 2003 SIGKDD Explorations special issue on microarray data mining, papers which focus solely on microarray data should include new developments since 2003.\r\n\r\nSchedule\r\n\r\n- Deadline for submissions: March 30\r\n- Notifications: April 30\r\n- Camera-ready due: May 15\r\n- Final issue handed to the editors: June 1\r\n\r\nSubmissions\r\n\r\nAll submissions should be made in PDF file following the SIGKDD Explorations format as shown in the templates and samples on the SIGKDD Explorations Web site.\r\n\r\nSubmissions should be made via email to the co-guest editors: Dr. Raymond Ng (rng@cs.ubc.ca) and Dr. Jian Pei (jpei@cs.sfu.ca).\r\n\r\nPotential contributors are welcome to discuss their intentions and interest with the co-guest editors.',Normal

'Dear FAU Student Body:\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Feb. 12 and Tuesday, Feb. 13, you, the students of Florida \r\nAtlantic University will have the rare opportunity to vote for a new \r\nstudent government constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Student Affairs has worked closely with representatives \r\nof the general student body and Student Government leaders to develop \r\nan improved Student Government constitution. Over the past several \r\nyears, the constitution has evolved without a coordinated review by the \r\ngeneral student body. For this reason, the Division of Student Affairs \r\ndeveloped a multi-step initiative that began in October to review and \r\namend the existing constitution.\r\n\r\nThe initial step in this process provided an opportunity for students \r\nto meet with an external student government consultant to review the \r\ncurrent constitution and provide guidance for the rewriting process.  \r\n\r\nThe second phase of this process provided an opportunity for all \r\nstudents to participate in two constitutional conventions. A new draft \r\nof the constitution was created by students during this process.  \r\n\r\nTo read the full document and the highlighted changes, visit the FAU \r\nhomepage at http://www.fau.edu and click on the button on the lower \r\nright that reads, \"Student Government Constitution.\" We believe you \r\nwill find the new constitution easier to read and understand. It \r\nreflects some of the following changes:\r\n? The elimination of a University-Wide Council and the  President\'s \r\nAdministrative Cabinet\r\n? The separation of power between the three branches of government\r\n? Each campus will have a House of Representative that will serve as a \r\nlegislative body\r\n? A clearly defined partnership with the Division of Student Affairs\r\n\r\nThe third and final stage in the student constitution revision process \r\nis the writing of new statutes. These statutes will govern the \r\nday-to-day functions of Student Government, including the allocation of \r\nyour activities and student services fees, estimated to be $6.5 \r\nmillion. Remember, these fees are used to fund University-wide \r\nfacilities, programs and activities that benefit all of you. This final \r\nstage will occur after a new constitution is ratified.\r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage all students to vote online on Monday, Feb. 12 \r\nand Tuesday, Feb. 13. Current students will receive a reminder e-mail \r\nonce the voting opens on Feb. 12. If you have any questions, please \r\nfeel free to e-mail me at clbrown@fau.edu.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCharles Brown, Ph.D.\r\nVice President for Student Affairs',Normal

'FAU\'s United Way Campaign is aimed at helping real people who face real challenges everyday. Here is one real-life story of how United Way has changed someone\'s life:\r\n\r\nAt just seven years old, Kenny (his name has been changed to protect his identity) has already experienced a lifetime of hardship. His father constantly abused his mother until she finally could not take the violence anymore and fled with Kenny. The two lived on the streets. Kenny\'s mom was hospitalized twice for a severe mental illness. At school, other kids made fun of Kenny\'s hand-me-down clothes. \r\n\r\nThanks to Adopt-A-Family, a United Way-funded agency that restores families in crisis to stability and self-sufficiency, Kenny and his mom got the help they needed. They now have a safe place to live and his mom received the necessary medicine for her bipolar disorder -- she has even earned her G.E.D. Thanks to tutoring services that were available, Kenny caught up in his studies and is now at the top of his class. In fact, now in the fourth grade, Kenny recently scored in the top five percent of all students taking the FCAT. \r\n\r\nUnited Way focuses on providing services that help families and children, like Kenny, improve their lives. Because of your support, programs are available for those who need them.\r\n\r\n',Normal

We’re coming to you today to ask for your participation in the 2006-07 campaign, which got under way on November 27 and will run through December 15.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnited Way organizations work hard all year long in critically important areas of human service:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         Providing food and shelter and meeting emergency needs\r\n\r\n·         Improving the future of children and families\r\n\r\n·         Fostering youth development\r\n\r\n·         Improving the lives of seniors\r\n\r\n·         Promoting independence for people with disabilities\r\n\r\n·         Promoting health and wellness\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile some of the multitude of services provided by the United Way and its member agencies are well known, others are not.  Did you know, for example, that through its Prosperity Campaign the United Way of Palm Beach County helps low-income working families move toward greater economic stability, higher earnings and home ownership? Or that economically disadvantaged children in need of orthodontic care can get the professional services they need through the United Way-affiliated Virginia Brown Orthodontic Program?  Did you know that the United Way of Broward County assists teens with their transition from foster care into adulthood and self-sufficiency through the Transitional Independent Living Program?  Or that the United Way of Martin County provides 40,000+ essential back-to-school items to about 7,000 Martin County students in need?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEvery year the United Way reaches more and more people of all ages, touching lives and changing futures.  We’re so proud that the FAU family has a long history of supporting the annual United Way campaign, and we’re confident that this year will produce another demonstration of how much we care about others in our community. Thank you in advance for your valued support of this worthwhile campaign to fund a broad array of human services.

In an account that belongs to this our foreign customer who died along with his wife and and children in the plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines buunfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it because I don\'t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner,I agree that 30\% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account. 10\% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60\% would be for me , after which I shallvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as I have arranged,you will furnished me with a good receiving account details where the money will betransfered,your private tel and fax number for easy communication.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text of the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance manager,for easy execution of the transaction.\r\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100\% hitch-free on both side. As all required arrangement have been made for the transfer and more so all the documents backing this claim will be supplied to you after you might have applied.Please I would like you you keep this transaction confidential and as a top secret as you may wish to know that I am a senior Bank official.\r\n\r\n',Spam
